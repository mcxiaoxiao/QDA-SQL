# StageFlow Inference Code Description

This folder contains Python example codes for inference using the StageFlow framework, as demonstrated in the paper. 
It utilizes the CoSQL dataset for its operations. 
ðŸ˜‰ Please ensure you download the CoSQL dataset from [CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql) 
and place it in the `datasets` folder before running the code. 
Below is a brief description of each `.py` file:

- **predict_complex.py**  
    Complete inference code, including all functionalities such as question type recognition and complex reasoning.

- **predict_IS_complex.py**  
    Inference code without question type recognition functionality, focusing on complex reasoning.

- **predict.py**  
    Standard inference code for general reasoning tasks.
